## Vouchers bad for rural schools
- talk about "woke" ideology is intentional marketing to get us to mistrust our own public schools
- Chase county has no private schools.  What benefit does school choice give to us?
- Tax Credit for wealthy donors 
- 80-90% of the dollars go to children already enrolled in private school.
- Private schools get the public's money with none of the accountability.  This will be opening the door to graft and profiteering. 
- Vouchers in Ohio & Louisiana reduced student academic outcomes by a factor that outpaced other disruptions, such as Covid-19 and Hurricane Katrina.
- Destruction of public education.
