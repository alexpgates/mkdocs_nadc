## Data Nebraska

Data Nebraska is just a hobby for me.  I cannot provide any warranty that the data presented on this website is correct or incorrect. Please refer to the NADC for verification on any questions you have about dollar figures, dates, contributions, expenditures, committees, payees, payors, etc.

## Data Processing and Tools

### NADC Data

Currently, all data on the site comes from files downloaded from the NADC (Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission) at [nadc-e.nebraska.gov/PublicSite/PublicMaster.master](https://nadc-e.nebraska.gov/PublicSite/PublicMaster.master)

- Go to `Resources` tab and choose `Download Data`

### Database
Files are processed into a Postgres database using the Python programming language.
These are the main python libraries that we are currently using.
