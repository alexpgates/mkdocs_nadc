# Donate to Data Nebraska

Data Nebraska is really just me, Tim.  I'm a development/database professional by day and I occasionally spend too much of my free time working on this project.  I don't necessarily need money to keep it up and running but it wouldn't hurt to upgrade a few things around here from time to time...maybe we could go full cloud based? fancy coffee to keep the wife happy... sour gummy worms for the kids?  I don't know.  Please don't feel obligated.  Whatever you decide, I appreciate you spending time taking a look and considering a donation. 

Thanks,
Tim
